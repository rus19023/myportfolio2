        <h3>What is granularity?</h3>
        <p class="normal-text">
          Let's compare building a data warehouse to a bakery. There can be many
          different items in the bakery: cakes, breads, cookies, etc. If you
          don't include all the ingredients, in the correct measurements, and
          follow each recipe's instructions using the correct utensils, the
          baked goods will fail to rise, or taste bad, or look ugly. Every day
          the baker makes many baked goods. He or she would need to calculate
          the quantity of each ingredient at scale needed for each of the
          completed goods, baked into differently shaped pans. The basic recipes
          would define the granularity, the least amount of each ingredient,
          each having the correct measurement, specific, ordered instructions to
          create a perfect product, no matter what shape or size it might end
          up.
        </p>

        <p class="normal-text">
          "Recipes" are also needed to design each OLAP cube or data mart, which
          are like the individual finished baked products. If you don't include
          all the ingredients (fact tables) in the right measurements
          (dimensions) and follow the instructions (use appropriate ETL Tools),
          the cubes will also fail to rise (not have all the layers, rows and
          columns), taste bad (not have the needed totals and subtotals) or just
          look ugly (have holes in the data slices and/or dices).
        </p>
        <p class="normal-text">
          Bakers will have experimented with different variables: measurements,
          similar ingredients, bake times, etc, to come up with their perfect
          version. They have spent many hours, used many ingredients, and thrown
          away many finished products before that perfect version. Similarly, a
          data mart recipe would need to be developed before the database is
          baked (filled with data for reports and analysis).
        </p>
        <p class="normal-text">
          The myriad ETL tools available today help to not "reinvent the wheel"
          when it comes to designing a data warehouse. However, just as the
          baker, before the baking begins, the database developer will need to
          fully understand the lowest proportions of ingredients (smallest
          grain) to fit the needs of the business purposes for the cube, then
          design the correct recipe using said granularity for their data store
          "recipe", to avoid wasted time and money.
